SpeakinTelnet Homelab-IaC
=========================

Refer to the `full documentation <https://Homelab-IaC.readthedocs.io>`_ for in-depth 
explanations.

.. readme-intro-start

Here lies my homelab's infrastructure as code (IaC) written in Ansible. I'm slowly
updating my current setup to be more readable, re-usable, and publicly available.
This here repository is but a blank slate. Another branch will be made available once
I'm done sterilizing my personal setup so you can use it as a filled reference.

Basic Usage
-----------

Prerequisite
************

For general usage:
  * Ansible user with ssh-key login to the managed system.
    This is auto-generated for lxc created with the provided playbook
  * An ansible vault key. ``ansible.cfg`` uses ``<ansible_root_folder>/.vault_key`` per default.

.. hint::
    Use your favorite password generator to create a strong password  in the .vault_key file.
    This key is used to encrypt the password/credentials/secrets for every services and host
    that requires some.

To auto-deploy lxc containers on proxmox:
  * Ansible user with ssh-key login to the proxmox Host 
  * Token with admin access to create and start the containers


Playbooks
*********

Multiple playbooks are provided to:

  * Populate a local proxmox node folder for configuration and variables purpose.
  * Populate various host_vars folders according to their appropriate services and add-ons. 
  * Auto deploy LXC containers on proxmox
  * Deploy and Update various services (e.g., Gitea, Grafana, Jellyfin, etc) 
    and add-ons (e.g., oh-my-zsh, Samba, etc)
  * Change user password across all hosts

What's next
-----------

  * Add screenshots and other appealing stuff
  * Continue to add services

  * Add other things to add
